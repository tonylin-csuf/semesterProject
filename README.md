# CPSC 449 – Web Back-End Engineering  
## ASP.NET Core Backend Project

This repository is the **starter and evolving codebase** for the CPSC 449 Web Back-End Engineering course.

Over the course, we will incrementally build a real-world ASP.NET Core Web API by:
- Designing RESTful endpoints
- Applying layered architecture
- Using dependency injection
- Integrating data persistence
- Evolving the system week by week

Each assignment builds on the previous work.
